                    <p> <strong>When booking a flight through TouroMint:</strong> It’s essential to familiarize yourself with the specific cancellation policies of the airline and booking platform you choose. Each provider may have different rules and fees regarding cancellations, including deadlines for free cancellations or penalty charges. Some airlines offer more flexible cancellation options than others, while some may charge fees for changes or cancellations regardless of the time frame. Carefully review these policies to understand your options if you need to adjust your plans. Being aware of the terms will help you make informed decisions and avoid unexpected costs.</p>

                <li>
                    <p> <strong>Refund policies:</strong> Refund policies can differ widely depending on the airline and booking platform. Eligibility for a refund may depend on the type of ticket you purchase, the timing of the cancellation, and the reason for canceling your booking. Some tickets, particularly non-refundable fares, may not qualify for refunds beyond taxes and fees. Additionally, processing times for refunds can vary, so be prepared for potential wait times. For specific questions about your refund eligibility, the amount you may receive, or the expected processing time, we recommend contacting the airline or booking platform directly. This direct communication will provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information for your specific booking.</p>
